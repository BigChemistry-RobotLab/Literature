            Editor’s summary
            
              Recent advances in experimental automation and integration with artificial intelligence (AI) have laid the foundation for so-called “self-driving labs,” but they remained limited to simple proof-of-concept experiments. Strieth-Kalthoff
              et al
              . introduced the concept of asynchronous cloud-based delocalized closed-loop (ACDC) discovery to drive multiple geographically distributed platforms in a single discovery campaign in which each unit operates as an independent, asynchronous worker executing experiments planned by a central AI entity. The ACDC concept has been successfully applied in the search for organic solid-state laser gain materials with state-of-the-art lasing performance, a challenging scientific problem with slow progress, thereby demonstrating the power of this closed-loop campaign. —Yury Suleymanov

              INTRODUCTION
              Modern materials discovery necessitates intricate workflows that integrate synthesis, property characterization, formulation, and system-level testing. Often, the required expertise and research infrastructure are dispersed across multiple locations and time zones, which hinders their integration into advanced discovery pipelines. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the context of automated experimentation and data-driven decision-making with artificial intelligence (AI), which usually rely on streamlined flows of data and materials at a single site.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Synergistically integrating experimental research infrastructure at geographically distributed sites requires a central, globally accessible cloud hub for data transfer; AI-informed experiment design; and logistics management. Such a decentralized engine can effectively orchestrate global design-make-test-analyze loops for materials discovery that would be impractical to establish in a single laboratory.
            
            
              RESULTS
              We demonstrate the distributed, AI-guided discovery of best-in-class small-molecule gain materials for organic solid-state lasers (OSLs). To overcome the prevalent synthesis bottleneck in molecular discovery, we devised a building block–based strategy to rapidly construct molecular function. Leveraging iterative Suzuki–Miyaura couplings, we developed a generalizable two-step one-pot protocol for assembling pentameric OSL gain materials from modular precursors, spanning a candidate space of {\textgreater}150,000 target materials. The preparation of building blocks was distributed over the available experimental resources at four geographic locations. Similarly, the assembly of building blocks to form the gain material candidates was parallelized and automated on different robotic synthesis platforms. This multisite synthesis engine was complemented by a resource-efficient, end-to-end automated testing workflow, encompassing (i) purification to a degree that allows for reliable spectroscopic measurements and (ii) solution-phase characterization through steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy.
              The resulting laser-like property data, asynchronously obtained from the different “workers,” fed into the central, machine learning–based experiment planning module hosted on the cloud hub. This module was supplemented with physical knowledge from quantum-chemical simulations and logistic constraints from multisite experimentation. Taking into account what could be done, what was being done, and what had been done at any point in time, the module maintained a ranked catalog of most-informative next experiments—from which the following sets of experiments were allocated to the available robotic platforms at the different sites.
              Throughout the development and operation of this multisite discovery engine, we found a total of 21 small-molecule emitters with improved emission gain cross sections compared with state-of-the-art OSL gain materials. For their property evaluation on a device level, on-scale synthesis and purification introduced further challenges, necessitating the development of automated workflows for synthesis with on-line decision-making and purification through continuous preferential crystallization. Ultimately, laser-like properties of three identified materials were measured in thin films, confirming the discovery of gain materials with best-in-class amplified spontaneous emission thresholds.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Addressing a frontier challenge in molecular optoelectronics, this work demonstrates a blueprint for decentralized (molecular) discovery in the age of AI. A central, readily accessible hub that manages data transfer, the logistics of materials transport and availability, and the experimental design process has proven to be of central importance. Eventually, we are convinced that scaling such a framework to flexibly include distributed human and robotic research resources can pave the way for democratizing (materials) discovery.

              Conjugated organic photoredox catalysts (OPCs) can promote a wide range of chemical transformations. It is challenging to predict the catalytic activities of OPCs from first principles, either by expert knowledge or by using a priori calculations, as catalyst activity depends on a complex range of interrelated properties. Organic photocatalysts and other catalyst systems have often been discovered by a mixture of design and trial and error. Here we report a two-step data-driven approach to the targeted synthesis of OPCs and the subsequent reaction optimization for metallophotocatalysis, demonstrated for decarboxylative

              cross-coupling of amino acids with aryl halides. Our approach uses a Bayesian optimization strategy coupled with encoding of key physical properties using molecular descriptors to identify promising OPCs from a virtual library of 560 candidate molecules. This led to OPC formulations that are competitive with iridium catalysts by exploring just 2.4\% of the available catalyst formulation space (107 of 4,500 possible reaction conditions).},
